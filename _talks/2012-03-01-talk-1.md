Prospective PhD Student Runyu Lu - HUST

Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Runyu Lu, 19 years old, a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in China, with a GPA of 3.95/4.00. 

I am writing to express my keen interest in joining the PhD program at [University Name] under your esteemed guidance, with a specific focus on **MLsys, particularly in LLM Serving and ML compilers**.I would like to know **whether or not you would enroll PhD Students** in 2024?

<!-- My Experience:  -->

1. Research Experience: Currently, I am serving as a research intern under the guidance of **Prof Hao Zhang at UCSD LMsys LAB**, where I am actively involved in profiling the bottlenecks of current LLM Serving Framework and contributing to a project aimed at enhancing the efficiency of LLM serving.I have also had the privilege of interning under the guidance of **Prof Lingming Zhang@UIUC PLSE Lab**, using LLM to fuzz Compilers like LLVM, with a paper already submitted to **FSE'24**(available on arxiv this month). Furthermore, I **co-authored** a paper related to Large Dynamic Graph Serving Acceleration, which is set to be submitted to **ICDE'24**, under the guidance of **Prof Hai Jin@HUST CGCL lab**.
  
2. Industry Experience: I once developed high performance neural network inference engine(18k+ star in Github now) for **Tencent Company**. I have also contributed to optimizing LLVM backends for GPU compilers while interning at **SenseTime Company**. These experiences have significantly enhanced my coding abilities. 

3. Future Plan: I really admire your reputation in MLsys and High performance computing your research about xxx really attracts me. In my eyes, we could xxxxx

<!-- 3. Technical Proficiency: Thanks to my previous academic and industrial experience, I have developed a strong skill set in various technical domains relevant to mlsys, including AI Infra(Torch, vLLM, Triton), HPC Tools(CUDA, NEON, AVX), and Compilers(MLIR, LLVM). -->

Attached please find my **CV, Transcripts, and Website link** at https://lry89757.github.io. I am genuinely excited about the prospect of joining your esteemed research group and would greatly appreciate your prompt response.

Best regards,

Runyu Lu
