Prospective PhD Student Runyu Lu - HUST

Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Runyu Lu, 19 years old, a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in China, with a GPA of 3.95/4.00. 

I am writing to express my keen interest in joining the PhD program at [University Name] under your esteemed guidance, with a specific focus on mlsys, particularly in LLM Serving and ML compilers.I would like to know whether or not you would enroll graduate students for doctoral degree in 2024?

My Experience: 

1. Research Experience: Currently, I am serving as a research intern under the guidance of Professor Hao Zhang at UCSD LMsys LAB, where I am actively involved in profiling the bottlenecks of current LLM Serving Framework and contributing to a project aimed at enhancing the efficiency of LLM serving.
  
2. Academic Contributions: I have also had the privilege of interning under the guidance of Prof Lingming Zhang@UIUC PLSE Lab, using LLM to detect the software flaws of Compiler like LLVM, with a paper already submitted to FSE'24(anticipated to be available on arxiv this month). Furthermore, I am co-authoring a paper related to Large Dynamic Graph Serving Acceleration, which is set to be submitted to ICDE'24, under the guidance of Prof Zhiyuan Shao and Prof Hai Jin at HUST HPC Lab.
  
3. Industry Experience: I once developed high performance neural network inference engine(18k+ star in Github now) for Tencent Company. I have also contributed to optimizing LLVM backends for GPU compilers while interning in SenseTime Company. These experiences have significantly enhanced my coding abilities. 
 
4. Technical Proficiency: Thanks to my previous academic and industrial experience, I have developed a strong skill set in various technical domains relevant to mlsys, including AI Infra(Torch, vLLM, Triton), HPC Tools(CUDA, NEON, AVX), and Compilers(MLIR, LLVM).

Attached please find my resume, transcripts, and a link to my personal webpage at https://lry89757.github.io. I am genuinely excited about the prospect of joining your esteemed research group and would greatly appreciate your prompt response.

Best regards,

Runyu Lu
